# Standing Order Landing Page

## Overview
Developed a prototype to automate the process of handling "Standing Orders," where clients book recurring weekly trips. The landing page allows clients to easily input their trip details, which are then validated on the client-side using React libraries and securely submitted to a PostgreSQL database via a minimal web API built with C#/ASP.NET. This solution simplifies the process for both clients and supervisors, reducing manual email communication and ensuring a more efficient review process.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, CSS
- **Backend**: C# / ASP.NET Core Minimal API
